<p>
	<strong>Bless English humour</strong>
</p>

<p>It is the great barbarous weapon of the genius among races.</p>
<p>The wild <b>mountain railway</b> from <b>idea</b> to <b>idea</b>, in the ancient Fair of <b>life.</b></p>
<p><strong>Bless</strong> <b>Swift</b> for his solemn bleak wisdom of laughter.</p>
<p><b>Shakespeare</b> for his bitter Northern Rhetoric of humour.</p>
<p><b>Bless all English eyes</b> that grow crows-feet with their <b>fancy</b> and <b>energy</b>.</p>
<p><strong>Bless</strong> this hysterical <b>wall</b> built round the <b>ego</b>.
<p><strong>Bless</strong> the solitude of <b>laughter.</b></p>
<p><strong>Bless</strong> the separating, ungregarious <b>British grin.</b></p>
