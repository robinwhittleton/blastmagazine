<h2>Project</h2>

<p>Blast Magazine was a short-lived magazine that aimed to chronicle the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorticism">Vorticist</a> art movement of the 1910s. More information on the context can be found at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_(magazine)">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>This is an attempt to digitise both editions, not just as a <abbr>PDF</abbr> or series of scans, but as a responsive and accessible <abbr>HTML</abbr> website.</p>

<p>Some / all of the contained material has opinions that are not representative of my opinions. While the project reproduces this as a historical artefact, that is the limit of the intent.</p>
